    <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An italian originated dish with tomato sauce, cheese, fresh basil and other optional toppings. It typically consists of a flat base of leavened 
        wheat-based dough, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. Drawing inspiration from the traditional topped flatbreads 
        of yore, pizza was first documented by name in 997 CE, in a text from southern Italy in which the son of a feudal lord pledges 12 pizzas to 
        the local bishop as an annual homage. The pizza we know today emerged in 18th-century Naples.</p>
